WIN/LOSE
Winning requires being the last sheep alive. It’s possible to win without directly killing any other sheep. Losing happens when you leave the perimeter (the fence) or get knocked over by opposing sheep.

STRATEGY
The best strategy seems to be waiting for 5-10 sheep remaining, then to SLOWLY attempt to either knock off course or knock over each remaining sheep. They can be coerced (seemingly randomly) into moving in a straight line that leads them to hit the fence. Otherwise, moving slowly around them leads to the best results.
